# Starting to Think about Projects and Contributioins

Today we started to think what kind of projects instests us enough to spend time on and make contributions too, keeping in mind that we are just startin out. 

### What types of contributions do you think are suitable choices for you to make as your first contributions to an open source project?

Even though I have some experience with open source and contributing to a project from my independent study, i still think of myself as a novice. Considering the experience I got from my independent study I still think I should start off slow for my first contributions to an open source project. I believe my first contributions should be eiter creating or imporving documentation whether it is code documentation or user documentation.
