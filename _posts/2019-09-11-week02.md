# Starting to Think about Projects and Contributioins

Today we started to think what kind of projects instests us enough to spend time on and make contributions too, keeping in mind that we are just startin out. 

### What types of contributions do you think are suitable choices for you to make as your first contributions to an open source project?

Even though I have some experience with open source and contributing to a project from my independent study, i still think of myself as a novice. Considering the experience I got from my independent study I still think I should start off slow for my first contributions to an open source project. I believe my first contributions should be eiter creating or imporving documentation whether it is code documentation or user documentation. If im going to do code documentation i would pick projects that is written in languages that im familiar with.

### What types of projects interest you and how do you see your relationship to them?

I want to take this opportunity and get to work on internet browser extentions such as Chrome browser extentions. There are alot of variety to these types of application rangeing from being able to change the wallpaper for the your browser to providing statistical data about the websites the user uses. I feel like exposing myself to these projects and trying to contribute to them can be fun and a learning experience.
