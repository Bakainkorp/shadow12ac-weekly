# Myths and Misconceptions about the world of Open Source

I had some experience with the open source community through my independent study. However, after reading this [article](stechrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-things-you-should-know-about-open-source-before-you-use-it/), I realized that I had alot of misconceptions about the open source world.

I have always thought that Open Source software have to both freely available and free of charge. But thats not always the case, companies are able to make money of open source software. Companies make the barebones of the software free but then attach a price tag to things like support or special features. Its instresting to see that Open source can become a business if its done correctly.

In addition, I never knew that Firefox and Notepad++ are open source software. When I first got in to programing, Notepad++ was the first text editor I ever used. It was very interesting to find out that many of the small application I use on a daily basis are actualy open source. 

Many of the other facts mentioned in the article I knew either from my independent study or from articles I read online. However, reading this article cleared the myths I had for open source software. It's clear that there is alot more to the open source community then I previously thought.
