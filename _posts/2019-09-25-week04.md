# My Experience with the In Class Git Activity and Reaction to the On-line Readings

### In Class Git Activity

I'm a very hands on learner. If I want some concept to stick in my head I need to try it out first hand and experience it myself. The git activity I did in class was very helpful. It gave me a chance to work with some of my classmates and practice git. I've had some experience using git and I'm familiar with the workflow, however I still found this activity to be fun. The idea behind it was very interesting and I found the exercise a great way to experience merge conflicts. While doing the activity I encountered at least two merge conflicts while pushing my changes to the remote repository. These were very simple conflicts that required easy edits to merge.
